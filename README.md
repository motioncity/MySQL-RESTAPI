# MySQL-RESTAPI
REST API using MySQL,Node and Express 


# Instructions for installing
In order for this to work you must have [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/), must also use a client for making POST calls , something like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

Once it has been downloaded, open up your command prompt and change directory to where this project is on your machine, then run the following

`npm install`


In the `database.js` file you must enter your MYSQL database credentials. And in your MySQL command client, you must run the commands in `CREATE.SQL` to create the Videos and Views tables in the database.

Once all of that has been done, you must start the server by running `node app.js` in the command line
